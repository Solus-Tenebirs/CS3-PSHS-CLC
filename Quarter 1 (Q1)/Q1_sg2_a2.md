The problem: Finding the highest (Maximum) number from a given list of numbers.


PseudoCode 1

PseudoCode 2

Algorithm FindMax1(numbers)

   max ← numbers[0]

   For i from 1 to length(numbers)-1

      If numbers[i] > max Then

         max ← numbers[i]

      EndIf

   EndFor

   Return max

EndAlgorithm



Algorithm FindMax2(numbers)

   For i from 0 to length(numbers)-1bigger ← true

      For j from 0 to length(numbers)-1

         If numbers[j] > numbers[i] Then

            bigger ← false

         EndIf

      EndFor

      If bigger = true Then

         Return numbers[i]

      EndIf

   EndFor

EndAlgorithm

Questions with Checklists
1. Efficiency
Which algorithm is faster when the list of numbers is very large? Why?

<u> I believe that the first pseudocode is faster when the list of numbers is very large because it contains
fewer calculations compared to the second pseudocode. The first pseudocode only has one loop, while the 
second has two nested loops that perform the same operation as the loop in the first pseudocode. </u>
